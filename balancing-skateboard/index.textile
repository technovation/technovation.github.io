**Abstract **

After successfully completing their Self-Balancing Robot under ITSP , this team is trying to extend their project to the next level by making a Skateboard that will try to balance itself when someone stands on i

<div>
  t ! Equipped with the experience from ITSP and mentored by our Tech seniors , the team is trying to complete it before the year end, so as to showcase it at Techfest !!!!<br /> They will also be trying to make it a tech-innovation by adding features like foldability, portability , an Android App to control the bot !!!!!<br /> Check out the following video :<br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtb4wUItBFQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtb4wUItBFQ</a>
