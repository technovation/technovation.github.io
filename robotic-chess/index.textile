**Abstract **

Love chess but no one to play with? How about robot to play with? Get the feel of “wizard chess” with this innovative project.

This project aims at designing a robotic arm and interactive chess board. The whole set will be portable. This arm would be linked to a chess program that would suggest the appropriate move. Set of 64 sensors would be used which would continuously analyze the game and feed the inputs of the real time player into the chess program. Furthermore if possible voice interaction will be installed.

Finally if successful this project can be scaled up to a human sized project on the same lines with some modifications just like the one shown in Harry Potter and the sorcerer’s stone.
