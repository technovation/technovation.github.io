  The above is a snap shot from &#8220;Future Retro&#8221; by Animusic, an American company that specializes in making animated videos where unrealistic instrument playing bots sync their motion with a background MIDI track &#8211; something that has captivated millionsof viewers globally for many years.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Although the designs of these bots are very interesting, there have been very few attempts to recreate Animusic bots in the real world, the closest being Intel&#8217;s version of Pipe Dreams.

  At Artificial Instrumentalist, we&#8217;re aiming to make a smart drumming robot based on the &#8220;Future Retro&#8221; drummer depicted above.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>The journey so far:</strong><br /> We&#8217;ve made many miniature striking mechanism prototypes and tested them for impact force and speed, and in Techfest 2013,we exhibited our first complete drummer prototype based on servo motors: <img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FNbi44UvtgkKLAO16xO5nxDaP1yXzhbiv4Vl16OmbWdvM3Px0flUw3nNpol7LsFxHUGHgmPU6zLKksxq6Hba3FI8NxUG6WgVo1-AtYVb0W8cyjQFNZ3ye5qsh3btNwSKJw" width="622px;" height="466px;" />
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  However, servo motors faced a thermal breakdown in this application, and the design had load distribution issues, hence we made many improvements to the design, tested out more striking mechanisms, and after several CAD&#8217;s and brainstorming sessions, are close to completing the fabrication process for the new prototype, which will be followed by assembly and testing in summers.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  On the coding front, development of a user-friendly interface for sending beat sequences to the bot is in progress.
