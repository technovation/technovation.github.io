**Abstract **

Measuring temperature of something without touching the surface or body has great application. Imagine measuring temperature of noxious or flammable chemicals in lab without going near them. Ever wondered how temperature of the stars is calculated? The answer to all these is “emissivity”.

The aim of the project is to make a gadget for calculating emissivity with minimum error possible. The next step is to make Non-Contact temperature measuring device using the theory of ‘Ratio Pyrometry’ and the calculated emissivity. This also includes improving and enhancing the device to accommodate wider temperature range and more accuracy and precision.

The next step is really challenging. This aims at developing process for “thermal imaging”.
