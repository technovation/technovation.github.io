  Our idea is to develop a unique ‘sixth sense’ which will enable a blind person to be able to navigate in the real world with relative ease.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  In order to achieve this, we have two main mechanisms:
</p>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Surface analyzing shoes: It will alert the person if there is something in front of him more than his foot size.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Spatial object distance: We plan to have sensors attached to different parts of the body such as the waist to find out distance of all objects around the user in real time.
  </p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">
  Based on the unevenness of the surface or the proximity of an obstacle, we will actuate pager motors spaced out at intervals of 10 degrees on a belt with proportional intensity.
</p>

Later, based on the rate at which an object is approaching the user, we can set better thresholds (eg. if a kid is running towards the user, we will get a rapid change in distance, so we can actuate that direction’s pager motor in a particular pattern to give an indication that something is rapidly approaching the user.)

<p dir="ltr">
  Once this basic setup is ready, we can also incorporate GPS so that the user gets signals which guide him/her to a particular location or add sound based I/O’s / incorporate Braille based control systems.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Timelines:
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  First 2-3 weeks on surface analyzing shoe and its testing  and next 3 weeks on belt and remaining time for experiments and in incorporating GPS system.
